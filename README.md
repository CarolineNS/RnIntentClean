Are you tired of scouring through long lists of apps when sharing pictures or open a file just to find a few apps that you use a lot?

Why are you app in my sharesheet or open mode sheet??

If I needed you, I'd open the app myself to use it!

RnIntentClean is an App that allow you to clean up your sharesheet and open mode sheet, which works with the Magisk modules "Riru-Core" and "Riru-IFW Enhance", and root permission.
