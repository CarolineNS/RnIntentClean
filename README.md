# RnShareClean
Are you tired of sharing pictures, scouring through long lists of apps just to find LINE, WhatsApp, Telegram and a few other apps you use?

Facebook, Youtube, Twitter........
Why are you guys on my picture sharing list?
If I needed you, I'd open the app myself to use it, so why take over my share list?

RnShareClean is an APP that works with the Magisk modules [Riru - Core](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru/releases/latest) and [Riru - IFW Enhance](https://github.com/Kr328/Riru-IFWEnhance/releases/latest), and you need to give them Root permission for writing IFW rules.

# You need to follow these steps to use
1. Install Magisk.
2. Install [Riru - Core](https://github.com/RikkaApps/Riru/releases/latest) and [Riru - IFW Enhance](https://github.com/Kr328/Riru-IFWEnhance/releases/latest) modules, which can be found in "Downloads" of Magisk Manager, or you can go to their Github release to download them (the link can be found in RnShareClean).
3. You may need to reboot the device to apply the module.
4. Open RnShareClean and give it Root permission.
5. Select the apps you DON'T WANT that appear in the list, you can make use of the Select All feature.
6. Click Submit.
7. Try to share picture and see if it works.

# Note
Note 1: Each time this application is launched, the IFW rules created by this application will be cleared when you click "Got it" and the set rules will be invalidated and will take effect again after you click Submit. It also clears when you switch the "Show System Apps" status.

Note 2: The implementation of this application relies on the following two Magisk modules, you must install them or RnShareClean will not take effect., even if you have given it Root permission. Due to version uncertainty, Riru - Core and Riru - IFW Enhance will most likely not support the version of Magisk that you have installed.

Note 3: Riru - IFW Enhance requires Riru - Core v19+ and Android 8.0+. Disable Direct Share may not take effect on Android 10+.

Note 4: RnShareClean works with IFW, so there is no guarantee that all systems will support IFW, but it has been tested on the following systems.

# Works System
1. Hydrogen/Oxygen OS with Android 10
2. MIUI 12 with Android 10
